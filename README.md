## Setup

This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
# Install pnpm with your preferred method: https://pnpm.io/installation.
npm i -g pnpm

# Install all dependencies.
pnpm i
```

## Packages vs apps

This repo contains two types of workspaces:

- `packages`: meant to be published to npm and installed,
- `apps`: meant to be executed.

A good example to illustrate the difference is `vite`: you wouldn't publish an app like this to npm, you would run it, more specifically you would build the JS bundle and then deploy that somewhere.

For packages, you don't want to bundle all the monorepo dependencies, and instead publish them individually. That's why packages have a separate build `tsconfig.json` that resolves monorepo dependencies to `node_modules`.
